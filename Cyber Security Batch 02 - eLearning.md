----------------------

This practical, hands-on course provides a complete introduction to modern cybersecurity and ethical hacking. Covering global standards such as CEH v13, CompTIA Security+, and NIST Cybersecurity Framework, it guides learners through real-world scenarios in threat detection, vulnerability assessment, system hardening, and incident response. Through hands-on labs and defense simulations, students gain the technical and analytical skills needed to secure systems and networks—preparing them for entry-level roles in cybersecurity, SOC operations, or ethical hacking.

----------------------

[[**1. Cybersecurity Fundamentals**]]

Learn the basics of cyber defence — from how attacks happen to how organizations protect their data. Students explore ethical hacking principles, threat types, and compliance awareness through local and global case examples. Keywords: Threat landscape, CIA triad, risk posture, cyber hygiene.

----------------------

**2. Network Security & Monitoring**

Understand how data travels through a network and how to detect suspicious activity. Hands-on practice analyzing traffic and identifying intrusion patterns. Keywords: Wireshark, tcpdump, network forensics, firewall tuning.

----------------------

**3. Information Gathering & Reconnaissance**

Learn to perform responsible information gathering using publicly available data. Students apply OSINT techniques and identify exposed digital assets safely. Keywords: Footprinting, WHOIS, DNS lookup, OSINT automation.

----------------------

**4. Vulnerability Assessment & Risk Prioritization**

Find and evaluate security weaknesses using real tools. Understand how to interpret scan results, rate risks, and communicate fixes clearly. Keywords: Nmap, Nessus, CVE mapping, remediation planning.

----------------------

**5. Operating System Security & Privilege Management**

Secure Windows and Linux systems through access control and auditing. Apply least-privilege concepts, review logs, and enforce user policies. Keywords: Privilege audit, log review, hardening, access management.

----------------------

**6. Web & Application Security Essentials**

Understand common website and API vulnerabilities and how to prevent them. Students test safely within a lab setup and learn secure coding principles. Keywords: OWASP Top 10, XSS, SQLi, input validation, secure coding.

----------------------

**7. System Hardening & Security Monitoring**

Reduce attack surfaces and detect misuse through continuous monitoring. Students implement configuration baselines and basic alerting techniques. Keywords: CIS Benchmarks, patch management, log correlation, SIEM basics.

----------------------

**8. Cloud Security Fundamentals**

Explore how to secure accounts and data in cloud environments like AWS and Azure. Students learn access control, encryption, and configuration best practices. Keywords: IAM, cloud misconfiguration, data encryption, cloud audit.

----------------------

**9. Incident Response & Reporting**

Understand how security teams detect and respond to real-world cyber incidents. Students follow the NIST process: Detect → Contain → Recover → Review. Keywords: IOC identification, containment, forensic triage, NIST 800-61.

----------------------

**10. Security Assessment & Career Path Planning**

Conduct a complete cybersecurity assessment and report findings professionally. Map your next certifications and career direction — SOC Analyst, Security Engineer, or CEH. Keywords: Recon-to-report, vulnerability lifecycle, SOC readiness, job roadmap.

----------------------

**11. Bug Bounty & Responsible Disclosure**

Learn how global companies reward ethical hackers for finding vulnerabilities. Understand disclosure policies, report writing, and communication ethics. Keywords: Bug bounty, disclosure process, report validation, platform standards.

----------------------

**12. Cybersecurity and AI**

Explore the intersection of artificial intelligence and cybersecurity. Understand AI-powered threat detection, adversarial attacks, and the future of security. Keywords: AI threat detection, adversarial machine learning, SOAR, machine learning security.

----------------------
