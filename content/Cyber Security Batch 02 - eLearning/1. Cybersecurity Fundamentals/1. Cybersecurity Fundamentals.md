# 1. Cybersecurity Fundamentals

## 1.1. Core Concepts: The CIA Triad
- [ ] **Define the [[Concepts/CIA Triad]]**
    - [ ] Explain **Confidentiality**: Preventing unauthorized disclosure of information.
        - [ ] *Concepts*: Encryption, Access Control, Steganography.
    - [ ] Explain **Integrity**: Ensuring data has not been altered or destroyed.
        - [ ] *Concepts*: Hashing, Digital Signatures, File Permissions.
    - [ ] Explain **Availability**: Ensuring timely and reliable access to information.
        - [ ] *Concepts*: Redundancy (RAID, Failover), Backups, DDoS Mitigation.
- [ ] **Analyze Real-World Breaches through the Lens of the CIA Triad**
    - [ ] *Confidentiality Breach Example*: 2017 Equifax breach (sensitive data exfiltrated).
    - [ ] *Integrity Breach Example*: Stuxnet worm (modified industrial controller logic).
    - [ ] *Availability Breach Example*: 2016 Dyn DNS attack (major websites taken offline).

## 1.2. The Human Element: Threat Actors
- [ ] **Categorize [[Concepts/Threat Actors]] by Motivation and Capability**
    - [ ] **Nation-States (APTs)**: High capability, motivated by espionage or strategic disruption.
    - [ ] **Cybercriminals**: Financially motivated, from individuals to large syndicates.
    - [ ] **Hacktivists**: Politically or socially motivated (e.g., Anonymous).
    - [ ] **Insiders**: Employees or partners.
        - [ ] *Malicious Insiders*: Intentional harm.
        - [ ] *Accidental Insiders*: Unintentional exposure through negligence.

## 1.3. Anatomy of an Attack: The Cyber Kill Chain
- [ ] **Explain the [[Concepts/Cyber Kill Chain]] Model (Lockheed Martin)**
    - [ ] **Step 1: Reconnaissance**: Gathering information on the target.
    - [ ] **Step 2: Weaponization**: Creating a malicious payload.
    - [ ] **Step 3: Delivery**: Transmitting the weapon to the target (e.g., email).
    - [ ] **Step 4: Exploitation**: Triggering the vulnerability.
    - [ ] **Step 5: Installation**: Installing malware on the asset.
    - [ ] **Step 6: Command & Control (C2)**: Creating a channel for remote manipulation.
    - [ ] **Step 7: Actions on Objectives**: Accomplishing the ultimate goal (e.g., data exfiltration).
- [ ] **Introduce Alternative Models**
    - [ ] Briefly compare with the [[Concepts/MITRE ATT&CK Framework]].

## 1.4. Defensive Strategies and Architectures
- [ ] **Compare [[Concepts/Defense in Depth]] vs. [[Concepts/Zero Trust Architecture]]**
    - [ ] **Defense in Depth**: The "castle and moat" approach.
        - [ ] *Layers*: Firewalls, IDS/IPS, Endpoint Protection, User Training.
    - [ ] **Zero Trust**: "Never trust, always verify."
        - [ ] *Principles*: Micro-segmentation, Identity and Access Management (IAM), Least Privilege Access.

## 1.5. Local Context and Legal Frameworks
- [ ] **Review Sri Lankan Cybersecurity Landscape**
    - [ ] Analyze notable local incidents (e.g., government website defacements, financial scams).
    - [ ] Discuss the role of the Sri Lanka CERT|CC.
- [ ] **Understand Key Legal and Ethical Boundaries**
    - [ ] Review the **Computer Crimes Act No. 24 of 2007 (Sri Lanka)**.
    - [ ] Compare with international laws like the **CFAA (USA)** and **GDPR (EU)**.

## 1.6. Risk Management Fundamentals
- [ ] **Perform a Qualitative [[Concepts/Risk Assessment]]**
    - [ ] **Step 1: Identify Assets**: What are we trying to protect?
    - [ ] **Step 2: Identify Threats**: What could harm the assets?
    - [ ] **Step 3: Identify Vulnerabilities**: What weaknesses can be exploited?
    - [ ] **Step 4: Determine Likelihood and Impact**: How likely is it, and how bad would it be?
    - [ ] **Step 5: Calculate Risk**: Risk = Likelihood x Impact.

## 1.7. Foundational Cyber Hygiene
- [ ] **Establish Best Practices for Individuals and Organizations**
    - [ ] **Password Security**: Complexity, uniqueness, and manager use.
    - [ ] **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Why it's critical.
    - [ ] **Software Updates & Patching**: The importance of timely updates.
    - [ ] **Phishing Awareness**: Recognizing and reporting suspicious emails.
