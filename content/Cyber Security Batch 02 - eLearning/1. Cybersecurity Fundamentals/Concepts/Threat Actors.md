| Threat Actor | Capability | Motivation | Speed | Detection Risk |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Nation-States | Extremely High | Strategic | Patient | Very Low |
| Crime Syndicates | High | Financial | Fast | Medium |
| Hacktivists | Medium | Ideological | Variable | Medium-High |
| Script Kiddies | Low | Curiosity/Profit | Opportunistic | High |
