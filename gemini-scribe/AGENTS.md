This file provides context about this Obsidian vault for AI agents.

## Vault Overview

This vault is a personal knowledge base for tharaka, created to organize notes and materials for an eLearning course. The primary focus is on the "Cyber Security Batch 02" course, with content structured to follow the curriculum.

## Organization

The vault is organized hierarchically, mirroring the structure of an academic course. A main folder, `Cyber Security Batch 02 - eLearning`, likely contains all course-related materials. Sub-folders are used for specific modules, such as `1. Cybersecurity Fundamentals`.

This numbered naming convention suggests a sequential, topic-based organization where notes are grouped by module in the order they are presented. The use of file names beginning with `//` seems to be a specific user convention, possibly for index notes or folder notes.

## Key Topics

- Cybersecurity
- eLearning and Course Notes
- Cybersecurity Fundamentals

## User Preferences

Based on the structure, tharaka prefers a highly organized and sequential approach to note-taking. The numbered folders indicate a preference for content that is easy to navigate and follows a clear, linear progression, similar to a syllabus.

The use of a specific file naming convention (`//...`) suggests an interest in consistent organizational patterns. Further preferences regarding writing style and level of detail will be learned over time as more content is added.

## Custom Instructions

- When creating new notes or folders for course modules, follow the established `[Number]. [Topic Name]` convention to maintain consistency.
- When summarizing or creating connections, prioritize linking concepts within the same module before connecting to broader topics.
- It would be helpful to clarify the purpose of the `//` prefix in file names before replicating that pattern.
- Since the vault's purpose is educational, focus on providing clear definitions, summaries, and explanations of key cybersecurity concepts.
