> Of course. This is where the power of a connected knowledge base really shines. We can break down the high-level tasks into more granular, actionable steps and create dedicated notes for core concepts. This will make your study process more organized and the relationships between topics clearer.
> 
> Let&#x27;s start with the first module, **[[1. Cybersecurity Fundamentals]]**, as a template for this approach.
> 
> ### Proposed Plan for Module 1:
> 
> I will transform the existing checklist in &#x60;[[1. Cybersecurity Fundamentals]]&#x60; into a more detailed outline. For foundational concepts like the &quot;CIA Triad&quot; or &quot;Cyber Kill Chain,&quot; I will create new, separate notes and link them directly from the main module note. This will allow you to build a rich, interconnected web of knowledge.
> 
> Here is the proposed detailed content for &#x60;[[1. Cybersecurity Fundamentals]]&#x60;:

> Excellent. I am proceeding with the plan for Module 2. This will take a few moments as I create the folders, update the main note, and create all the new concept notes.
> 
> I have now created the &#x60;Concepts&#x60; folder for Module 2. I will now create the rest of the files.I have successfully updated your notes for **Module 2: Network Security &amp; Monitoring**.
> 
> 1.  The main note, [[Cyber Security Batch 02 - eLearning/2. Network Security &amp; Monitoring/2. Network Security &amp; Monitoring]], has been updated with the detailed, granular task list.
> 2.  A new sub-folder has been created at &amp;#x60;Cyber Security Batch 02 - eLearning/2. Network Security &amp; Monitoring/Concepts/&amp;#x60;.
> 3.  The following new notes have been created within that folder and are now linked from the main module note:
>     *   [[OSI and TCP/IP Models]]
>     *   [[Wireshark Fundamentals]]
>     *   [[tcpdump]]
>     *   [[Port Scanning]]
>     *   [[ARP Spoofing]]
>     *   [[DNS Tunneling]]
>     *   [[Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)]]
>     *   [[Firewalls]]
>     *   [[iptables]]
>     *   [[IDS and IPS]]
>     *   [[Snort]]
>     *   [[Network Forensics]]
> 
> Your second module is now ready for you to dive in and start adding detailed notes.
> 
> Would you like to continue this process with **Module 3: Information Gathering &amp; Reconnaissance**?

> Of course. Let&#x27;s structure **Module 3: Information Gathering &amp;amp; Reconnaissance**. This module is all about building a comprehensive picture of a target using publicly available information, a critical first step in any security assessment.

> Here is the proposed detailed content for &#x60;[[3. Information Gathering &amp; Reconnaissance]]&#x60;:

> 
> # 3. Information Gathering &amp; Reconnaissance
> 
> ## 3.1. Reconnaissance Methodologies
> - [ ] **Differentiate between [[Passive vs. Active Reconnaissance]]**
>     - [ ] **Passive**: Gathering information without directly engaging with the target&#x27;s systems (e.g., search engines, public records). Goal: Remain undetected.
>     - [ ] **Active**: Directly probing target systems (e.g., port scanning, server interaction). Goal: Gather detailed technical data. Carries a risk of detection.
> 
> ## 3.2. Foundational OSINT Techniques
> - [ ] **Master Search Engine Reconnaissance: [[Google Dorking]]**
>     - [ ] Understand key operators: &#x60;site:&#x60;, &#x60;inurl:&#x60;, &#x60;intitle:&#x60;, &#x60;filetype:&#x60;.
>     - [ ] Practice finding sensitive information: Login pages, exposed documents (&#x60;.pdf&#x60;, &#x60;.xls&#x60;), error messages.
>     - [ ] Explore the Google Hacking Database (GHDB) for advanced queries.
> - [ ] **Extract Domain and IP Information**
>     - [ ] **Perform [[WHOIS]] Lookups**:
>         - [ ] Identify registrant name, contact details, domain registration/expiry dates, and nameservers.
>     - [ ] **Conduct [[DNS Enumeration]]**:
>         - [ ] Use &#x60;nslookup&#x60; and &#x60;dig&#x60; for manual queries.
>         - [ ] Identify key DNS records: &#x60;A&#x60; (Host), &#x60;MX&#x60; (Mail), &#x60;NS&#x60; (Name Server), &#x60;TXT&#x60; (SPF, DKIM).
> 
> ## 3.3. Infrastructure and People Mapping
> - [ ] **Map Publicly Exposed Infrastructure**
>     - [ ] **Use [[Shodan]]**: &quot;The search engine for hackers.&quot;
>         - [ ] Find devices by type (e.g., webcams, routers), technology (e.g., Apache), or organization.
>         - [ ] Identify open ports and vulnerable service banners.
>     - [ ] **Use [[Censys]]**:
>         - [ ] Discover hosts, websites, and certificates associated with a target.
> - [ ] **Gather Employee Data Responsibly**
>     - [ ] Use LinkedIn to identify roles, responsibilities, and potential contacts.
>     - [ ] Correlate names with email address formats (e.g., &#x60;first.last@company.com&#x60;).
>     - [ ] *Ethical Consideration*: Emphasize the responsible and legal limits of this activity.
> 
> ## 3.4. Technical Footprinting
> - [ ] **Perform [[Subdomain Enumeration]]**
>     - [ ] Use online tools and search engines.
>     - [ ] Leverage Certificate Transparency logs.
>     - [ ] Use command-line tools like &#x60;[[Sublist3r]]&#x60; or &#x60;amass&#x60;.
> - [ ] **Conduct [[Technology Stack Identification]]**
>     - [ ] Use browser extensions like &#x60;[[Wappalyzer]]&#x60; or &#x60;BuiltWith&#x60;.
>     - [ ] Identify the target&#x27;s CMS (e.g., WordPress), web server (e.g., Nginx), JavaScript frameworks (e.g., React), and analytics tools.
> 
> ## 3.5. Automated OSINT Collection
> - [ ] **Automate Data Gathering with [[theHarvester]]**
>     - [ ] Collect emails, subdomains, hosts, and open ports from multiple public sources (e.g., Google, Bing, Shodan).
> - [ ] **Visualize Connections with [[Maltego]]**
>     - [ ] Understand the graph-based approach to link disparate pieces of public information.
>     - [ ] Perform &quot;transforms&quot; to pivot from one data point (like a domain) to related entities (like DNS names, IP addresses, or employee names).
> 
> ## 3.6. Documentation and Reporting
> - [ ] **Develop a [[Reconnaissance Reporting]] Template**
>     - [ ] **Section 1: Executive Summary**: High-level overview of findings.
>     - [ ] **Section 2: Scope**: Clearly define the target domains/IPs.
>     - [ ] **Section 3: Findings**: Detail all discovered information (domains, IPs, technologies, emails).
>     - [ ] **Section 4: Evidence**: Provide screenshots, command outputs, and links.
>     - [ ] **Section 5: Potential Attack Vectors**: Hypothesize how this information could be used by an attacker.
>

> 
> ### Action Plan:
> 
> If this detailed plan is to your liking, I will:
> 1.  **Update the content** of the &#x60;[[3. Information Gathering &amp; Reconnaissance]]&#x60; note.
> 2.  **Create a new &#x60;Concepts&#x60; folder** within the Module 3 directory.
> 3.  **Create the following new placeholder notes** for you to populate:
>     *   &#x60;[[Passive vs. Active Reconnaissance]]&#x60;
>     *   &#x60;[[Google Dorking]]&#x60;
>     *   &#x60;[[WHOIS]]&#x60;
>     *   &#x60;[[DNS Enumeration]]&#x60;
>     *   &#x60;[[Shodan]]&#x60;
>     *   &#x60;[[Censys]]&#x60;
>     *   &#x60;[[Subdomain Enumeration]]&#x60;
>     *   &#x60;[[Sublist3r]]&#x60;
>     *   &#x60;[[Technology Stack Identification]]&#x60;
>     *   &#x60;[[Wappalyzer]]&#x60;
>     *   &#x60;[[theHarvester]]&#x60;
>     *   &#x60;[[Maltego]]&#x60;
>     *   &#x60;[[Reconnaissance Reporting]]&#x60;
> 
> This will establish a robust and interconnected structure for your third module.
> 
> **Shall I proceed?**
